# I want to remove big `exclude_lines` that skip important code. If I need some lines excluded (like `if __name__ == "__main__":`) then I can leave them designated in the code via the tag (included at the end of the line) called `# pragma: no cover`. I have some lines I don't want to cover but I can do it without much
# Go ahead with the rest, omit *only* the test files & conftest.py. Everything else should be available publicly to the testing code, I am just breaking the testing code into modular items.

# I truly do not want coverage for test files themselves. The test files are designed to be organized and well-written and as a result, we shouldn't make them any more extensive than they have got to be. In my opinion, we should make them even smaller.
