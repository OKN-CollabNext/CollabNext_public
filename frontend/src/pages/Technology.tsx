            FRINK will be hosting knowledge graphs for all the Proto-OKN
            projects, which will help with data integration and linkage across

            Currently, our data requires both RDF and RDF-star triples. FRINK is
            not yet able to support the RDF-star specification, so the alpha
            version of our web application us using the publicly available
            SPARQL endpoint provided by SemOpenAlex. We also leverage some
            Postgres SQL data for certain APIs, and we plan to have this RDBMS
            hosted by FRINK in the future. Since our future plans involve
            integrating OpenAlex data with other data sources (eg MUP), we
            anticipate having both graph databases and relational databases (and
            potentially NoSQL databases, too) for flexibility, schema
            integration, and to be able to optimize performance.

            Two of our challenges are Topic Classification and Name
            disambiguation. We are currently using OpenAlex subfields as topic
            classifiers, but it is becoming increasingly clear that we will need
            to build a robust Machine Learning model to help bridge human
            understandable research topics and semantic web ontologies and data
            schemas which may categorize research topics in a more
            machine-friendly way.

            Name disambiguation will always be a challenge for us since we want
            to maintain a person-focused approach. In addition to the built-in
            algorithms used by OpenAlex, we are developing internal models which
            use more current AI and ML research, and which we believe will yield
            animprovement for all our entity resolution challenges.
