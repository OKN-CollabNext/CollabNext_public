            Currently, our data requires both RDF and RDF-star triples. FRINK
            is not yet able to support the RDF-star specification, so the
            alpha version of our web application is using the publicly
            available SPARQL endpoint provided by SemOpenAlex. We also
            leverage some Postgres SQL data for certain APIs, and plan to
            have this hosted by FRINK in the future. Since our future plans
            involve integrating OpenAlex data with other data sources
            (e.g., MUP), we anticipate having multiple database types for
            flexibility and performance.

            The web application for CollabNext is currently designed with a

          <h2>Name Disambiguation & Topic Classification</h2>
          <p>
            Two key challenges are Topic Classification and Name
            disambiguation. We currently use OpenAlex subfields as topic
            classifiers, but we plan to develop a robust ML model to connect
            human-understandable research topics with semantic web ontologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Name disambiguation remains difficult because we want a
            person-focused approach. In addition to the built-in OpenAlex
            algorithms, we are developing internal models that leverage
            modern AI and ML techniques for entity resolution.
